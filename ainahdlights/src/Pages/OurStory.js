            <p id="story">This picture of my children was taken when Ainah DLights took off in 2005. They were my backbone at that time, running errands, and helping me out in the kitchen. I branded them my little helpers, and thought that they deserved the credit. Hence, this picture was born!</p>
            <br></br>
            <p id="story">When we started off, this business was born out of desperation to feed the children, to prepare for their new school year, and for Hari Raya clothes and shoes for them, as we were not financially stable. Little did we know, we began to receive overwhelming support from our friends, family, and even strangers alike! They continuously supported us, despite any shortcomings, and amateur mistakes. And for that, we are eternally grateful. This same group of people are still with us, and continue to be our faithful customers, and eventually friends.</p>

            <p id="story">A blogspot was set up in ye olden days, and we reached out to customers via e-mail and word of mouth. I was fielding calls all day, pre-Whatsapp! We eventually migrated to Facebook, and now.... Instagram! A bit late, I know, to move to Instagram ad Facebook, but my little helpers are still at it, helping me now with technology and social media advancements. We thank all our past and present customers, and hope to reach out to more of you!</p>
